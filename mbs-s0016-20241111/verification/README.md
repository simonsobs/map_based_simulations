# Simulation verification

## CO Lines

[Verify CO Lines notebook](verify_CO.ipynb)

## Power spectra

All components except CO and Radio Galaxies,
the B Spectra of the CMB components are affected by high noise due to `ud_grade` performed in the on-the-fly run with PySM inside the notebook.
If the run is properly executed at Nside 4096, no artificial noise is visible anymore.

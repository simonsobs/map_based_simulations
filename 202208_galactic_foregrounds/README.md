## Verification

Interactive power spectra plots for all components except CO and radio galaxies, the source notebooks are available in the `verification/` folder:

* [SAT TT](https://nbviewer.org/gist/zonca/3645fe8042c7d913213f3dbd647be0d5)
* [LAT TT](https://nbviewer.org/gist/zonca/7026e5f4fd9ef304a89f1c171e43f2ce)

## Known issues

* Websky Radio sources are available only down to 18.7 GHz, the lowest Simons Observatory channels have bandpasses to 10 Ghz, so I created a copy of 18.7 GHz and renamed it to 1.0 GHz. This is the border of the band, should not matter much.

Data Management is outlining key activities and internal milestones for the next six months. This plan is concise and focused on actionable steps, not project schedule deliverables.

- Based on feedback from AWG and on the timeline of future time domain simulations, prepare a new map based simulation release similar to [MBS-16](https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations/tree/main/mbs-s0016-20241111) with updated instrument model (bands, beams).
- If compatible with availability of models in PySM, run multiple extragalactic components on top of Websky (Half-dome, Agora) useful for comparison.

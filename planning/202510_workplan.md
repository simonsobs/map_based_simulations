Data Management is outlining key activities and internal milestones for the next six months. This plan is concise and focused on actionable steps, not project schedule deliverables.

- Develop a comprehensive proposal for the next set of map domain simulations (in the style of [MBS-16](https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations/tree/main/mbs-s0016-20241111)), specifying planned updates to both the instrument model (e.g., frequency bands, beam profiles) and the sky model (e.g., extragalactic components, foregrounds). Execution will not begin at this stage. Solicit and incorporate feedback from all Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) that utilize these simulation products.
- If compatible with availability of models in PySM, run multiple extragalactic components on top of Websky (Half-dome, possibly [Agora](https://github.com/galsci/pysm/issues/181#issuecomment-3348825093)) useful for comparison.
- Track and support the implementation of bandpass sampling capability in PySM ([issue #228](https://github.com/galsci/pysm/issues/228)). This feature, previously used in MBS-16, aims to generalize bandpass sampling functions and integrate them into PySM, enabling their use by processing scripts in `map_based_simulations`.
